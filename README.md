# Jaydev Parmar
High school student focusing on **technology**, **design**, and **hardware** for fun and to build a strong foundation.
<br/>
I like working close to the system, understanding how things work under the hood, and turning ideas into practical builds.


## Areas of Focus
- **Software Engineering** — C / C++ / Python / JavaScript
- **Embedded & Hardware** — microcontrollers, PCB design, low-level systems
- **Design** — minimal, functional, purpose-driven


## Tools and Tech
- Git · GitHub · Astro JS · KiCad · Onshape
- Custom scripts and automation

## Long-Term Goal
- Develop strong, real-world engineering skills
- Build projects that demonstrate depth, not buzzwords
- Position myself for impactful roles in tech and hardware engineering

## Presence
